In our proposed methods, we will incorporate context information generated by VRAE into the Seq2seq model. It is naturally to think about add more generic features of sentences more than just context information: which may include the sentiment, the semantic structure, the topic and so on.

A recent research about controllable text generation \cite{hu2017controllable} combines unstructured latent code $z$ with structured code $c$ targeting attributes of sentences to control. Here each of structured variables $c$ targets a salient and independent semantic feature of sentences. What's more, they introduced a discriminator to enforce the generator (decoder)  produce attributes coherent with the conditioned code. The learning of their model is a process of alternating the optimization of the generator and the discriminator. Their proposed model can be seen as a hybrid of vanilla VAE and wake-sleep method. Our next step involves investigating more deeply into the structured code and see if we can make improvement by incorporating GAN framework into our existing diaglog system.
